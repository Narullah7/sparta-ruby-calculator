# Brief

I created a basic ruby program which would run a calculator simulation in iTerm with the users input.The calculator features included addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, square-roots and BMI.

# Difficulties

* One difficulty I had was in the begging i didn't know how to approach making a calculator using functions, but I was quickly able to grasp the idea and managed to make a working product.

* Another difficulty was trying to sort out the conditions for the square root and the division, however again I was able to get to grips with it fast and complete it.

# What Im most pleased with

I am most pleased that my calculator runs properly and displays the correct answer for each part of the calculator.
I learnt a lot from this homework, and I feel a little more confident about using functions in ruby.
